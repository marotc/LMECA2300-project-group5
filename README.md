Lid-Driven Cavity
===================================

Simulation of a cavity driven by one or two lids, using the SPH method.

To run, do `make` in the `build/` directory, then run `bin/anm` and follow the instructions to setup some parameters.

If you wish to run the Youtube simulation using save data, first download `data.zip` from Microsoft Teams, and extract the data/ directory to the root of the project (that is, at the same level as build).
